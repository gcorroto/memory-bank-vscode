> **PREREQUISITE**: This extension requires [Memory Bank MCP](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@grec0/memory-bank-mcp) installed and configured with at least one indexed project. Without the MCP, this extension will not display any data.

## What is Memory Bank Inspector?

**Memory Bank Inspector** is the visual interface to explore data generated by [Memory Bank MCP](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@grec0/memory-bank-mcp).

| Memory Bank MCP | Memory Bank Inspector (this extension) |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------|
| Indexes your code with embeddings | Visualizes indexed projects |
| Generates documentation with AI | Displays documentation in Markdown |
| Semantic search (RAG) | Navigates files and relationships |

---

## Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Configure Memory Bank MCP

Before using this extension, you need Memory Bank MCP configured in your AI client.

Add this to your MCP client configuration (Cursor, Claude Desktop, etc.):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "memory-bank": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@grec0/memory-bank-mcp@latest"],
      "env": {
        "OPENAI_API_KEY": "sk-your-api-key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Index a Project with the MCP

Use your AI agent to initialize and index a project:


Once the paths and files have been registered in .memoryignore and the template's instruction md file has been created with the projectId defined.

![MCP Initialization](images/mcp_init_index.png)

We initialize mcp by requesting indexing of documentation and code in the memory bank

![MCP Indexing Process](images/mcp_init_index_2.png)

We wait about 5 minutes for every 100 files

![MCP Indexing Complete](images/mcp_init_index_3.png)

We asked for the general documentation to verify correct indexing.

> See the [MCP documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@grec0/memory-bank-mcp) for more details.

### Step 3: Install the Extension

1. Open Visual Studio Code
2. Go to **Extensions** (`Ctrl+Shift+X`)
3. Search for **"Memory Bank Inspector"**
4. Click **Install**

### Step 4: Configure the Extension

After installation, configure the path where the MCP stores data:

1. Open **Settings** (`Ctrl+,`)
2. Search for `memorybank.path`
3. Enter the path to your `.memorybank` folder

```json
{
  "memorybank.path": "C:\\Users\\your-username\\.memorybank"
}
```

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `memorybank.path` | Path to the `.memorybank` folder generated by the MCP |
| `memorybank.openai.apiKey` | OpenAI API Key (optional, only for Code Relations AI descriptions) |

## Extension Features

### Sidebar Overview

![Extension Sidebar](images/extension_init_index.png)

sidebar with the 4 extension panels

### Project Explorer

![Project List](images/extension_init_index_2.png)

focus on the detail of an element of any tree

- Lists all projects indexed by the MCP
- Shows document count and last update
- Allows project deletion (includes embeddings cleanup)

### Indexed Files Tree

![Indexed Files](images/extension_init_index_3.png)

Opening generated project documentation file

- Navigate indexed files organized in folders
- View file information (chunks, hash)
- Open files directly in the editor

### Framework Components Explorer

![Framework Components](images/framework_components_placeholder.png)

Automatically detects frameworks (React, Spring Boot, NestJS, etc.) and lists components:

- **Component organization**: Groups files by their role (Controllers, Services, Components, Hooks, Stores)
- **Endpoint detection**: Shows HTTP endpoints and routes defined in the code
- **Easy navigation**: Jump directly to the component implementation
- **Supported frameworks**: Spring Boot, NestJS, Angular, React, Vue, Django, FastAPI, Flask, Express

### Documentation Viewer

![Documentation](images/extension_init_index_4.png)

Opening generated project decision log file

View documentation automatically generated by the MCP:

- **projectBrief.md** - General project description
- **techContext.md** - Technology stack
- **systemPatterns.md** - Architecture patterns
- **activeContext.md** - Current session context
- **progress.md** - Project status
- **decisionLog.md** - Technical decisions

![Documentation Detail](images/extension_init_index_5.png)

states and messages from the generation of the relationship dataflow for the entire project

### Code Relations (Dataflow Viewer)

![Code Relations Overview](images/extension_init_index_6.png)

Example of the result generated for a relationship dataflow from a Java API

Visualize relationships between code components:

- Automatic analysis of imports and dependencies
- Interactive visualization with React Flow
- AI-generated descriptions (requires OpenAI API Key)
- Node highlighting when selecting to follow dependencies

![Code Relations Analysis](images/extension_init_index_7.png)

highlighting direct relationships with the selected entity

![Code Relations Graph](images/extension_init_index_8.png)

Highlighting of direct relationships with the selected entity and description of the service generated by AI

![Code Relations Selection](images/extension_init_index_9.png)

opening file directly from the dataflow

![Code Relations Detail](images/extension_init_index_10.png)

creating a React project and querying the previously indexed Java project to implement the necessary views and services

### Active Agents Monitor (Multi-Agent)

![Active Agents](images/active_agents.png)

This view provides real-time visibility into the **Memory Bank MCP Multi-Agent System**. It visualizes the state of the `agentBoard.md` file, allowing developers to coordinate with AI agents.

**Features:**
- **Active Agents**: Displays all agents registered in the system (e.g., `Dev-Agent`, `Architect-Agent`), their current status (`ACTIVE`, `IDLE`), and their current task focus.
- **Resource Locking**: visualizes the **File Locks** system. See exactly which files are currently "claimed" by an agent to prevent race conditions during parallel work.
- **System Logs**: A live feed of coordination messages, showing when agents register, claim resources, or complete tasks.

**How it works:**
The extension watches for changes in `.memorybank/projects/{projectId}/docs/agentBoard.md`. When an MCP agent (using tools like `memorybank_manage_agents`) updates its status or locks a file, this view updates automatically.

### Working with AI Agents
